## üìù Task

### 1. **Create the Product Model**

Create a Django model named `Product` with fields:

```python
from django.db import models

class Product(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    expiration_date = models.DateField()
    is_active = models.BooleanField(default=True)
```

---

### 2. **Implement a Periodic Celery Task**

* The task should run once a day (using Celery Beat).
* Query products whose `expiration_date` is less than or equal to today and `is_active` is True.
* For each expired product, set `is_active` to False and save.
* Print or log how many products were marked inactive.

---

### 3. **Add Task Timeout Handling**

* Simulate a long task by adding a sleep (e.g., `time.sleep(30)`) inside the task.
* Set a **soft timeout** of 10 seconds and a **hard timeout** of 15 seconds for the task.
* Catch the `SoftTimeLimitExceeded` exception and log a warning that the task timed out.
* Ensure the task exits gracefully without crashing.
